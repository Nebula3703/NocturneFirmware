# Coding Style Guide

This style guide applies to all C, C++, and embedded code in Nocturne Firmware.

## General

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level (no tabs)
- Follow consistent naming: `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Keep functions small and modular
- Include headers and comments where needed
- Avoid hardcoding â€” use defines and constants

## C Headers

- Header guards in all `.h` files
- Group includes: standard, third-party, local

## Comments

Use clear inline and block comments to explain logic and tricky sections.
