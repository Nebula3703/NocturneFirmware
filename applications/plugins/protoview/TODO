Core improvements
=================

- Decoders should declare the short pulse duration range, so that
  only matching decoders will be called. This may also be useful for
  modulations. If a signal is only OOK, does not make much sense to
  call it for samples obtained in FSK.
- More protocols, especially TPMS and other stuff not supported right now
  by the Flipper.
- CC1101 synchronous mode with protocol hopping?
- Protocols decoded can register actions, for instance to generate
  sub files with modified signal and so forth.
- Optimize memory usage storing raw samples in a bitfield: 15 bits
  duration, 1 bit level.
